## How You Talk To The User

**NoteCove is the only interaction surface.** There is no orchestrator relaying messages and no chat interface — you and the user communicate directly through the task itself:

- **Comments** carry the conversation, in both directions. You post; the user replies; you read the reply.
- **Notes** carry artifacts. Plans, findings, question sets, designs — anything longer than a short paragraph.
- **Task state** carries intent. Only you and the user change it.

Each agent runs with a **sidecar** — a generic watcher process (`scripts/sidecar.sh`) that monitors your task and, when the user comments or changes the state, **types a message into your Claude REPL**. You do not block and you do not poll: you hand the task back and end your turn, and the reply arrives as a new turn.

### The interaction cycle

```bash
post_summary "<brief summary of what you just did>"
request_attention "Attention"
```

`request_attention` sets the task state and **returns immediately** — it does not wait. End your turn once it returns. Anything you write after it in the same turn will not be reached by the user's reply.

**Every round of work owes the user a comment.** `resume_work` reopens that obligation and `request_attention` will not let you leave without meeting it: if you have posted nothing since the last `resume_work`, it writes a generic placeholder in your place. That placeholder is a failure mode, not a feature — it tells the user only that you want something, not what. Call `post_summary` yourself.

Keep it under **900 characters**. NoteCove rejects a longer comment outright, and until recently that rejection was silent — the summary vanished and the user was handed a task in `Attention` with no explanation. `post_summary` now truncates rather than dropping, but a truncated summary is still a summary you wrote badly. Anything that does not fit belongs in a note the comment names.

### Resuming after a message

A delivered message looks like `[agentmesh] New activity on <slug> — …`. Start that turn by getting back into working shape:

```bash
source {{AGENTMESH}}/scripts/agent-notecove.sh
agent_init "<slug>" "{{AGENT_USER}}"
resume_work                # back to Doing — you are working again
read_inbox                 # what the sidecar had to tell you
```

`read_inbox` prints line-delimited JSON and clears the inbox:

```
{"kind":"comment","id":"...","author":"gara","content":"looks good, ship it","created":...}
{"kind":"state-change","from":"doing","to":"...","to_name":"Won't Do"}
{"kind":"pr-merged","url":"https://github.com/foo/bar/pull/1","note":"PR was merged. Set the task to Done."}
```

An **empty** `read_inbox` is normal, not an error: a message can arrive for a change you have already drained. Nothing new means carry on with what you were doing.

### Messages can arrive while you are working

That is the point of delivering them rather than signalling: a message typed into your REPL mid-turn is queued by Claude Code and handed to you when the current turn ends. So a reply is no longer stuck behind your next `request_attention`.

When one arrives mid-work, read the inbox, fold what it says into what you are doing, and **stay in `Doing`** — you are still working. Only `request_attention` hands the task back.

### Comments are summaries, not documents

Keep every comment to **a few sentences at most**. A comment is a notification: it tells the user what happened and where to look. Anything longer — reasoning, findings, option analysis, code, tables — goes in a NoteCove note, and the comment names that note.

Write "Wrote PLAN: 8 phases, one PR. Two open risks noted in the Delivery section." — not three paragraphs restating the plan.

### Reading the user's reply

Interpret free text with judgement; the user writes naturally ("the linter is failing", "there are conflicts, resolve them").

Two words are **reserved commands** and must be honoured literally rather than read as feedback:

- `approve` — the work is accepted. Move the task to its terminal state (`Done`) yourself.
- `abort` — stop. Set the task to `Won't Do` and exit.

Echo your reading back in your next comment ("Read as: approve → marking Done") so a misinterpretation is visible to the user instead of silent.

### You own your task's state

You and the user are the only ones who change task state. Nothing else will do it for you:

- Call `resume_work` (→ `Doing`) as the first action of **every** working turn: on startup, and again each time a delivered message puts you back to work. `Doing` means "an agent is working on this right now".
- Call `request_attention` (→ `Attention`) only when you are finished for now and the user has the task. A task left in `Attention` while you work misreports both.
- Never run a bare `notecove task change --state ...`. `set_state` (which `resume_work`, `request_attention` and `finish_task` all go through) records the state in `signals/<slug>.self-state` first, so the sidecar can tell your own move from the user's. Without that marker your own writes come back to you as messages.
- **Finish with `finish_task`**, never a bare state change:

```bash
finish_task "Done" "<project>"        # the user approved
finish_task "Won't Do" "<project>"    # the user aborted
```

`finish_task` sets the state *and* runs the cleanup that has to happen with it: releasing tasks blocked on this one, and stopping this task's sidecar and pr-monitor. Nothing else does either — a bare `notecove task change --state Done` leaves dependent tasks blocked forever and leaks two processes.

If `read_inbox` reports a `state-change` you did not make — the user moved the task to `Won't Do`, `Blocked`, or anything terminal — stop work and exit. Do not call `finish_task`, which would overwrite their state; call `finish_cleanup` instead:

```bash
finish_cleanup "<project>"    # the user set the terminal state; still release dependents
```

The cleanup is still required even though you did not set the state: nothing else releases tasks blocked on this one or stops your sidecar.

### If you create a PR

Call `watch_pr "$PR_URL"` right after creating it, before `request_attention`:

```bash
watch_pr "$PR_URL"
```

That starts a monitor which delivers a message to you when the PR is merged, so a user who merges on GitHub instead of commenting `approve` still gets a response. Without it, a merge is invisible to you and the task sits in `Attention` indefinitely.

### If you were restarted mid-task

You may be a replacement for a worker that died. The launcher spawns a fresh worker for any task left in `Doing` or `Attention` with no live worker window, so finding existing notes in your task folder is normal, not an error.

Read them before doing anything: a `PLAN`, `QUESTIONS-<N>`, or `COMPLETION` note means that work is already done. Pick up from where it left off rather than repeating it, and check the task's comments for the conversation so far.

Also drain your inbox at startup (`read_inbox`, Step 1 below). A reply the user left while the previous worker was dying is still sitting there, and nothing will deliver it again.

---

## Step 1: Initialize

```bash
LOG={{AGENTMESH}}/signals/events.log
source {{AGENTMESH}}/scripts/agent-notecove.sh
agent_init "<slug>" "{{AGENT_USER}}"
resume_work                # claim the task: Doing
read_inbox                 # drain anything left by a previous worker
printf '%s\t{{LOG_PREFIX}}\tstarted\t<slug>\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" >> "$LOG"
```

`agent_init` also resolves **`$TASK_REF`** — the unambiguous full slug of your task (`WORK-abc:hatbqq77qtm4g4x76zz6de5`). Use it, not `<slug>`, whenever you call the `notecove` CLI yourself:

```bash
notecove task show "$TASK_REF" --format markdown-with-comments
```

The short slug is a *uniquePrefix*: unique only at the moment it was read. A task created while you are working can lengthen it, and your copy then matches several tasks. The CLI does not fail on that — it **prompts**, and since you are inside a tmux window with a TTY, the call hangs until it times out. The helper functions all go through `$TASK_REF` already; raw calls are the gap.

`agent_init` does two more things besides setting your handle. It clears `signals/<slug>.launching`, the flag the launcher uses to keep its next scan from spawning a second worker for this task while you were booting — claiming the task by setting `Doing` is what releases it. And it writes `signals/<slug>.ready`, the sidecar's gate for typing into your REPL: until it exists the sidecar records changes in your inbox but delivers nothing, because `spawn-agent.sh` may still be typing your skill invocation and a message would land in the middle of that command line. That is why Step 1 drains the inbox.

The handle passed to `agent_init` **must** match the `--user` value your comments carry (`{{AGENT_USER}}`) — the sidecar filters your own comments by author name, so a mismatch makes you wake yourself on every comment you write.

## Shared Critical Rules

- **Always `source {{AGENTMESH}}/scripts/agent-notecove.sh` + `agent_init <slug> "{{AGENT_USER}}"`** at startup, and define `LOG=`. Write `printf '%s\t{{LOG_PREFIX}}\t<event>\t<slug>\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" >> "$LOG"` at each phase transition (started, awaiting-user, resumed, implementing, pr-created, approved/feedback-received).
- **Never interact with the user outside NoteCove.** No terminal output intended for them, no other channel.
- **Always post a summary comment before `request_attention`** — otherwise the user is handed a task with no explanation of what you want. A generic placeholder is posted in your place if you skip it; that is a visible failure, not a get-out.
- **Keep comments under 900 characters.** NoteCove rejects longer ones; `post_summary` truncates to stay inside the limit.
- **Use `$TASK_REF`, not the short slug, in raw `notecove` calls.** A short slug can go ambiguous while you work, and the CLI then prompts and hangs instead of failing.
- **Keep comments brief.** A few sentences. Artifacts belong in notes.
- **`request_attention` does not block — end your turn after it.** Do not poll the inbox, do not sleep, do not call it in a loop. The sidecar starts your next turn by typing a message into your REPL.
- **Call `resume_work` at the top of every working turn.** `Doing` while you work, `Attention` only when the user has the task.
- **Never change state with a bare `notecove task change --state ...`** — go through `resume_work` / `request_attention` / `finish_task`, which record the move so the sidecar does not report it back to you.
- **An empty `read_inbox` is not an error.** It means nothing new; carry on.
- **Always finish with `finish_task "<state>" "<project>"`** — never a bare `notecove task change --state Done`. It is what releases blocked dependents and stops your sidecar; nothing else does.
- **If the user set the terminal state**, call `finish_cleanup "<project>"` instead — their state stands, but the cleanup is still owed.
- **Call `watch_pr "$PR_URL"` after creating a PR** — otherwise a merge on GitHub never reaches you.
- **Check your task folder for existing notes at startup** — you may be a restarted worker, and repeating finished work wastes the user's time.
